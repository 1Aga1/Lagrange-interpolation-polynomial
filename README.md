# Lagrange interpolation polynomial
 
The algorithm was developed for the purposes of the educational process. It implements the ability to enter :
1. The number of nodes of the function
2. Coordinates of the node
3. Node values
The algorithm builds a formula depending on the entered X and outputs the result of the calculation using the formula
